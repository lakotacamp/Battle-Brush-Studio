Battle Brush Studio!

This is an ongoing project for me to tinker with and learn how to work with 3d models in a full stack service.
The code for each file is ugly, but at each break I have commented out a previous version of the code with an explanation of what it was doing, what I wanted to change, what was not working with it, and other information I thought would be useful for understanding my process in developing this app.
Longterm the goal is to allow the user to upload their own 3d model (not just gltf) and have it saved to a cloud based api. Cloudinary does not seem optimal for this purpose, and I want to go back and rebuild the backend in MongoDB.
Currently the only models that are available are saved in the public folder, but the app does allow the user to select from those models and modify their colors with full crud.
Built with React, Bcrypt, and flask SQL.
